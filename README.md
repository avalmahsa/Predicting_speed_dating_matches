# Predicting_speed_dating_matches
Speed dating analysis using:
- preprocessing and data exploration
- parameter search
- pipelining
- **models used**: XGBClassifier, Random forest, Linear regression, Support vector machines, and MLPs
- **dataset**: uses speed dating dataset available on Kaggle: 
- **goal**: conducting EDA,proprocessing and modeling to predict a match (1) or no match (0) after the speed dating session. Goal is to see model performance using different hyperparameter and preprocessing search methods (using pipeline).
- full_dumentation file provides more detail on EDA and modeling findings
