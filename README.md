# Predicting_speed_dating_matches
Focuses on parameter search, pipelining, and preprocessing.
Uses speed dating dataset available on Kaggle: conducting EDA,proprocessing and modeling to predict a match (1) or no match (0) after the speed dating session. Goal is to see model performance using different hyperparameter and preprocessing search methods (using pipeline).
